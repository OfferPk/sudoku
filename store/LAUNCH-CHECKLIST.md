# Launch checklist: Quillnine on Google Play (new personal account)

## Roman Urdu mein khulasa (short summary)

1. **Play Console account banao:** play.google.com/console par "Yourself" (personal) chuno, **$25 ek dafa** fee do, aur apna **ID card / identity verify** karo. Verification mein kuch din lag sakte hain.
2. **App banao:** naam "Quillnine: Calm Sudoku", Game, Free. Phir "App content" ke sawal `play-console-answers.md` se copy karo, aur store listing `listing-en.md` se. Tasveerein `store/` folder mein hain.
3. **Closed testing:** v1.0.0 wali **AAB** file closed testing track par upload karo. **Play App Signing** on rakho (Google-generated key).
4. **12 testers, 14 din:** kam az kam **12 log (behtar hai 15–20)** opt-in karein aur **lagatar 14 din** tak test mein rahein. Beech mein koi nikal gaya to ginti dobara ho sakti hai.
5. **Production ke liye apply karo:** 14 din ke baad Dashboard par "Apply for production" dabao aur sawalon ke jawab do.
6. **AdMob:** app banao, **Banner, Interstitial, Rewarded** teen ad units banao, **GDPR (UMP) message** publish karo. App Play par live hone ke baad AdMob mein Play se **link** karo.
7. **IDs mujhe bhejo:** AdMob **App ID** aur teeno **ad unit IDs** mujhe do. Main inhein `www/js/ads-config.js` aur `AndroidManifest.xml` mein laga kar naya version (v1.0.1) bana dunga. Wo version production mein jayega.
8. **Kabhi apne ads par khud click na karo.** Is se AdMob account band ho sakta hai.
9. **Target audience:** sirf **13–15, 16–17 aur 18+** tick karo (bachon wale age groups nahin). Data safety mein AdMob wale 4 data types bharo (details `play-console-answers.md` mein hain).
10. **Upload key ka backup:** `sudoku-key-backup.zip` (keystore + password file) ko kisi mehfooz jagah, jaise USB ya password manager, mein rakho. GitHub par kabhi mat daalna. Key gum ho jaye to Play Console se upload key reset karwani padegi.
11. **Game mein koi purchase nahin:** coins sirf puzzles solve karne se milte hain aur sirf cosmetic themes par lagte hain. Isliye Console mein "In-app purchases: No" aur "Financial features: None" chuno.

- 15–20 friends or family with Android phones and Gmail accounts (testers).
- The files in this `store/` folder.

## Part A: Create your Play Console developer account

2. Choose **"Yourself"** (personal account). Do not choose "An organization" unless you have a registered company with a D-U-N-S number.

9. If asked, install the **Google Play Console** app on your Android phone and sign in, to verify that you have a real device.
10. When the account shows as verified, continue.

---

## Part C: Closed testing with Play App Signing and the v1.0.0 AAB

1. Download the AAB to your computer:
   https://github.com/OfferPk/sudoku/releases/download/v1.0.0/sudoku-v1.0.0.aab
2. Go to **Test and release → Testing → Closed testing**.
3. Open the default track (often called **"Closed testing – Alpha"**) and click **Manage track**. You can also create a new track.
4. **Countries/regions tab:** add the countries where your testers live (for example Pakistan). You can also add all countries.
5. **Testers tab:**
   - Choose **Email lists → Create email list**.
   - Name it "Testers" and add **15–20 Gmail addresses**. Add more than 12 in case someone drops out.
   - Add a **feedback email or URL** (your email is fine).
   - Click **Save**.
6. **Releases tab → Create new release.**
7. **Play App Signing:** when asked about the app signing key, keep **"Use a Google-generated key"** (the default) and accept. Google keeps the real signing key safe. The key in our GitHub Actions (the repository secrets) is now your **upload key**.
   - Keep a backup of the upload keystore file and its passwords in a safe place (the build box has `/workspace/keybackup/sudoku-key-backup.zip`). If you lose it, you can ask Google support to reset the upload key, but it takes time.
8. **Upload** `sudoku-v1.0.0.aab`. Play will read the package `com.offerpk.sudoku`, version 1.0.0 (code 1).
9. **Release name:** `1.0.0`. **Release notes** (en-US):
   ```
   First test release of Quillnine. Please solve a few puzzles (try different difficulties and the daily puzzle) and tell us about any problem.
   ```
10. Click **Next**, fix any errors, then **Save**.
11. Go to **Publishing overview** and click **Send changes for review**. Review usually takes 1–7 days for a new app.
12. When the release is live, go back to **Closed testing → Testers** and copy the **opt-in link** ("Join on the web").
13. Send that link to all your testers. Each tester must:
    - Open the link while signed in with the **same Gmail** you added to the list.
    - Click **"Become a tester"**.
    - Install the app from the Google Play link on that page.
    - **Stay in the test.** They should not click "Leave the program".
    - Open and play the game a few times during the 14 days, and send you short feedback.

> Note: v1.0.0 still uses Google's **test ad IDs**, so testers will see "Test Ad" banners. That is fine and safe for testing. The real ad IDs go into v1.0.1 (see Part F).

---

## Part D: The 12 testers / 14 days rule

- This applies to **personal accounts created after 13 Nov 2023**.
- You need **at least 12 testers opted in** to your closed test.
- They must stay opted in **continuously for the last 14 days** before you apply.
- The count starts when testers **actually opt in**, not when you send the email.
- If someone opts out and joins again, their days start again from zero.
- If you drop below 12, add new testers quickly. The 14-day window must be unbroken.
- Check progress on the **Dashboard**. It shows how many testers are opted in and for how many days.
- Tip: invite 15–20 people. Keep a simple list with their name, Gmail, the date they joined, and their feedback. You will need this for the production questions.
- You can upload a newer build (for example v1.0.1 with real ads) to the **same closed track** during the test. Testers stay opted in.
- Official rule: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14151465

---

## Part E: Apply for production

1. After 14 full days with 12+ testers, go to **Dashboard**. Click **Apply for production**.
2. Answer the questions honestly and in detail. For example:
   - How you found testers (friends, family, colleagues).
   - What they tested (all five difficulties, the daily puzzle, notes, highlights, undo/erase, mistakes and continue, hints, pause, resume after closing, stats, themes, settings, ads).
   - What feedback you got and what you changed. Even small fixes count (for example, "added real ad IDs and turned off test mode in v1.0.1").
   - Why the app is ready (stable, no crashes, every puzzle has one solution and is graded by a logical solver, works offline, progress saved).
3. Submit. Google usually answers within about 7 days.
4. When approved: go to **Test and release → Production → Create new release**.
   - Upload the **newest AAB** (v1.0.1 with real ad IDs, see Part F), or promote the release from closed testing.
   - Choose countries/regions.
   - Add release notes, then **Save → Send changes for review**.
5. After review, the app is live on Google Play. 🎉

If Google says "more testing needed", keep the closed test running, collect more feedback, make an improvement, and apply again.

## Part F: AdMob setup

### F1. Create the AdMob account and the app
1. Go to https://apps.admob.com and sign in with the **same Google account**.
2. Finish the sign-up: country **Pakistan**, your time zone, and billing currency. You can't change the currency later.
3. Click **Apps → Add app**.
4. Platform: **Android**.
5. "Is the app listed on a supported app store?" → **No** (it is not live yet).
6. App name: `Quillnine`. Click **Add app**.
7. Copy the **App ID**. It looks like `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456~1234567890` (note the **~**).

### F2. Create 3 ad units
In your app in AdMob, click **Ad units → Add ad unit** and create these one by one:

| Type | Name to use | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| **Banner** | `Banner_Bottom` | Default settings |
| **Interstitial** | `Interstitial_Puzzle_Complete` | Default settings |
| **Rewarded** | `Rewarded_Help` | Reward amount **1**, reward item **hint**. Leave server-side verification off. |

Copy each **ad unit ID**. It looks like `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456/1234567890` (note the **/**).

### F3. GDPR consent message (UMP)
The game already asks for consent with Google's UMP SDK. You only need to create and publish the message.
1. In AdMob, go to **Privacy & messaging**.
2. Open **European regulations (GDPR)** and click **Create message**.
3. Choose the app **Quillnine**, and the language **English** (add more if you like).
4. **Privacy policy URL:** `https://offerpk.github.io/sudoku/privacy.html`
5. Keep the options **"Consent"** and **"Manage options"**. You can also turn on **"Close (do not consent)"**.
6. Click **Publish**.
7. (Optional) Also create a **US state regulations** message in the same place and publish it.

### F4. Payments (so you can get paid)
1. In AdMob, go to **Payments** and fill in your payment profile and tax info.
2. When earnings reach about $10, Google mails a **PIN** to your address. Enter it in AdMob.
3. Add your bank account. Google pays when your balance passes the payment threshold.

### F5. Test safely
- Add your own phone as a **test device**: AdMob → **Settings → Test devices**.
- **Never click your own real ads**, and don't ask friends to click them. That can get your AdMob account banned.

### F6. Link AdMob to Google Play (after the app is live)
1. Wait until the app is **published on Google Play** (production).
2. In AdMob, go to **Apps → View all apps → Quillnine → App settings**.
3. Under **App store details**, click **Add** and search for `com.offerpk.sudoku` or "Quillnine".
4. Select it and click **Add**. AdMob then reviews the app. Ads may be limited until the review is done.
5. (Recommended) **app-ads.txt:** AdMob will give you a line like
   `google.com, pub-1234567890123456, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0`.
   It must be at the root of the **website** listed on your Play store page. Ask me and I can set this up. It needs a small `offerpk.github.io` site so the file lives at `https://offerpk.github.io/app-ads.txt`.

---

## Part G: Send me the IDs

When AdMob is ready, send me these 4 values (and your publisher ID for app-ads.txt):

```
App ID:           ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~XXXXXXXXXX
Banner ID:        ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX
Interstitial ID:  ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX
Rewarded ID:      ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX
Publisher ID:     pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Ad IDs are not secret, so it's fine to send them in chat. **Never** send your passwords or keystore file.

Then I will:
1. Put the IDs in `www/js/ads-config.js` and set `IS_TESTING: false`.
2. Put the App ID in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (`com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID`).
3. Bump the version to **1.0.1 (versionCode 2)**.
4. Tag **v1.0.1** so GitHub Actions builds the signed AAB and creates the release.
5. Give you the new AAB link. You upload it to the closed test track (and later to production).
